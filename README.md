# MWS Project 1 - Accessible and Responsive Web Apps

## Goal of the Project

For the Restaurant Reviews projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In Stage Three, you will take the connected application you built in Stage One and Stage Two and add additional functionality. You will add a form to allow users to create their own reviews. If the app is offline, your form will defer updating to the remote database until a connection is established. Finally, youâ€™ll work to optimize your site to meet even stricter performance benchmarks than the previous project, and test again using Lighthouse.

## Getting Started;
To build the application:
```
npm i
npx webpack
gulp
```
Clone or download the repository.
Start up an HTTP server, you can use Python.

Using Python:

```
python -m http.server 8000
```

Open url [localhost:8000/build](localhost:8000/build) in your favorite browser.
